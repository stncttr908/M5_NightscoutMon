### M5Stack Nightscout Monitor

M5Stack is small development kit based on ESP32. It is in a nice plastic box, equipped with color display, micro SD card slot, 3 buttons, speaker and internal battery. It is great to monitor and display something, so I used it to monitor my daughter's glycemia. It is nice, comfortable and cheap solution.

We use Abbott Freestyle Libre, together with MiaoMiao transmitter. It transmits the glycemia values to her mobile phone (we used to use Spike on iPhone, but you can also use Tomato on iPhone or xDrip, Glimp and more on Android). The daughter’s mobile phone then sends data to the Nightscout, where we (parents) watch it using the web application or a mobile phone (Spike, Nightscout, …). We use the small M5Stack monitor with my software to monitor the glycemia during nights in our sleeping room, my wife has one in the kitchen and we take one always on our trips. It has different backlight intensity for night usage and alarms for hypo/hyper glycemia situations.

**In short it displays information from Nightscout site and provides visual and sound alarms if needed.**

Some people were asking for the software. I am not a professional programmer, I am a hardware engineer, but I work more with tables, numbers and e-mails recent years, so I was a little bit shy about the code. As there is quite a lot of people interested in something that shows current values and makes alarms during nights, I decided to release the code as an Open Source.

If you know what to do with it, just download the code, modify it any way it suits you and use it in M5Stack. If you do not know how to handle the source code, just find someone who can. It is easy, just open it in Arduino IDE, install the **M5Unified**, **ArduinoJson** and **Adafruit NeoPixel** libraries and build it to your M5Stack. The firmware uses the M5Unified library and auto-detects the board, so a single build supports the whole current 16&nbsp;MB lineup: **M5Stack Basic v2.7, Fire v2.7, Core2 v1.1 and CoreS3 (ESP32-S3)**. When building for the classic Basic (`M5Stack-Core-ESP32`) select the **Minimal SPIFFS** partition scheme so the firmware fits while keeping OTA updates; the other boards work with the default partition. The official M5Stack store is here https://m5stack.com/products/basic-core-iot-development-kit. The current price is about 27.95 USD (9 February 2020). You can also buy it on Aliexpress https://www.aliexpress.com/item/M5Stack-Official-Stock-Offer-ESP32-Basic-Core-Development-Kit-Extensible-Micro-Control-Wifi-BLE-IoT-Prototype/32837164440.html or elsewhere.

**You will need a microSD card.** It has to be formatted to FAT32 format and you have to put at least M5NS.INI file with configuration to the root of the microSD card. It is a good idea to put M5_NightscoutMon.jpg files to the SD card root too. You can replace M5_NightscoutMon.jpg with any 320x240 pixels picture if you want to customize your experience.

**You have to update M5NS.INI file to your requirements. As a minimum requirement you will need to update your Nightscout URL and your WiFi SSID and password.**<br/>

### Display

There are currently 5 display pages, that can be changed by a short press of the right button. The button does not work when the device communicated with Nightscout (small blue WiFi icon is displayed).

**Page 0 - default page**  
What you see on the display is a matter of your M5NS.INI and Nightscout configuration. By default you will see current time, date and user name from config file in upper left corner. You will see IOB (Insulin On Board) an COB (Carbs On Board) values below the name. Right from the IOB/COB value is current BG delta (difference from the last reading, trend where the BG is going). Box with time difference from last valid data from Nighscout is displayed in upper right corner. Delay of 5 mins is OK and the box has grey color, 5-15 mins is warning and the box will have white background, more than 15 mins without a valid data is error and the box background will be red. There is also possibility to set sound warning on data delay in M5NS.INI.

Glycemia (BG) value and its direction are below the basic information. There is a mini graph created from 10 last BG values right of the glycemia value. The mini graph shows only values in range 3-12 mmol/L (48-216 mg/dL) and values below/above this will be displayed on mini graph as the min/max values.

There are also icons in upper side of display. Plug or battery icon displays battery status (on newer devices only). Red clock indicated silent "snooze" mode activated. Grey or yellow (more than 5 errors) shows that there are errors in error log (last page). Blue WiFi icon in 2 sizes (2 different queries) indicated that MStack is downloading data from Nightscout.

Last line contains icons for buttons or data source or Loop information (depending on M5NS.INI key "info_line").  

**Page 1 - simple page with large BG value**  
Long distance visible page with large BG value and larger clock. Top line contains current time, icons, delta value a BG direction arrow.

Bottom info line is the same as on page 0.

**Page 2 - analog clock with temperature and humidity**  
Large analog clock with date. BG value in top left corner with time difference from the last reading. BG delta value in top right corner and arrow pointing chinge direction below it.

This screen contatins environmental values form DHT12 sensor. Requires ENV Unit or BTC Standing Base connected to MStack. The temperature is in lower left corner and humidity in lower right corner. Temperature unit can be set in M5NS.INI.

Bottom info line is the same as on page 0.

**Error Log page**
Displays last 10 record errors and total number of errors record since last restart. Occasional communication errors, such as "timeout" or "connection refused" are normal and happen sometimes due to WiFi and internet connection and Nightscout site status. If you have a lot of errors every few minutes, consider to move your M5Stack to a different place or extend WiFi signal.  

**Web config QR code page**
Shows a QR code encoding the device's local IP address (`http://a.b.c.d`). Scan it with a phone camera to open the device's web configuration page directly, without needing to type in an address or rely on `<name>.local` (which doesn't work reliably if several M5NS devices are on the same network). If WiFi is disconnected or the internal web server is disabled in M5NS.INI, the page shows a message instead of the QR code. On entry the device checks GitHub for a newer firmware release; if one is available, the bottom row shows **UPDATE** and the middle button installs it directly from the device, with no browser needed.

Neither the Error Log page nor this page show the loop/basal status row (`L: ... B: ...`) that appears on the other pages - it isn't relevant here, and on this page the middle button has a different job.

### Local REST API & Home Assistant / MQTT Integration

#### Non-Persistent REST API Endpoints
All API endpoints take effect immediately in RAM without writing to NVS flash or SD card:

* `GET /api/status`: Unified JSON telemetry (SGV, delta, direction, screen, brightness, page, snooze, battery, power source).
* `GET /api/power`: Real-time PMIC power source (`mains`/`battery`), charging status, battery percentage, and voltage.
* `GET /api/screen?val=<on|off|toggle>`: Control screen backlight while background loops and network polling stay active.
* `GET /api/brightness?val=<0-100>`: Direct backlight brightness level (0-100%).
* `GET /api/action/brightness`: Emulate tapping the left touch button (cycle brightness presets).
* `GET /api/page?val=<0-3>`: Jump directly to a specific UI page.
* `GET /api/action/page`: Emulate tapping the right touch button (cycle page).
* `GET /api/action/snooze`: Emulate tapping the middle touch button (trigger/extend alarm snooze).
* `GET /api/refresh?interval=<min>` or `seconds=<sec>`: Dynamic runtime polling interval control.

#### MQTT & Home Assistant Auto-Discovery
Enable MQTT in `M5NS.INI` or via the Web Config portal:

```ini
mqtt_enabled = 1
mqtt_server = 10.10.2.1
mqtt_port = 1883
mqtt_user = 
mqtt_pass = 
mqtt_topic_prefix = m5ns
mqtt_ha_discovery = 1
```

* **Home Assistant Integration**: Automatically discovers Glucose (SGV), Delta, Trend Direction, Battery %, Voltage, Power Source, Charging state, Screen Power switch, Brightness control, and Snooze action button with zero YAML.
* **Command Topics**: `<prefix>/<deviceId>/screen/set`, `.../brightness/set`, `.../page/set`, `.../snooze/set`, `.../refresh/set`.
* **State Topic**: `<prefix>/<deviceId>/state` (full JSON) and individual subtopics.

<br/>

### Buttons

The **left button** changes the backlight in the 3 steps defined in M5NS.INI file.

The **middle button** snoozes M5Stack for defined time to prevent alarm or warning sound. You can "snooze" it even before the alarm is activated. Snooze active is indicated by red clock icon in status icon area. You can press "snooze" more times to make snooze time longer. It cycles 1x - 2x - 3x - 4x - OFF and again. You have 2s to press button again, otherwise it starts from 1x. The "snooze" function is distributed to all devices in your local network with the same Nightscout user (Nightscout URL).

On the **web config QR code page** only, the middle button does not snooze - it installs a firmware update if one is shown as available (see above), and does nothing otherwise. It goes back to snoozing as soon as you switch to any other page.

Short press of the **right button** switches display pages. Long press (4 seconds) puts M5Stack to the sleep as it is a little bit tricky to double click standard red power button.

### Battery

Battery icon feature works only on newer M5Stack units. Here are my battery measurements and battery icon statuses:

| internal battery total                   |  43 min |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------: |
| plug icon _(full charge or plugged in)_  |   1 min |
| gray full battery icon                   |  13 min |
| white 2/3 battery icon                   |  20 min |
| yellow 1/3 battery icon                  |   8 min |
| red empty battery icon                   |   1 min |

---

| extended battery total                   |  7h 49 min |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------: |
| plug icon _(full charge or plugged in)_  |        53m |
| gray full battery icon                   | 2 h 59 min |
| white 2/3 battery icon                   | 1 h 55 min |
| yellow 1/3 battery icon                  | 1 h 48 min |
| red empty battery icon                   |     14 min |

### Installation and support

Installation can be done by download or git clone the code to the Arduino IDE environment. You have to download ESP32 board and M5Stack libraries, Arduino JSON library and build it to you M5Stack.

Another easier possibility is to download latest [M5Burner release](https://github.com/mlukasek/M5_NightscoutMon/releases). It is Windows executable with binary M5Stack firmware included. Just unzip it, start the M5Burner.exe, choose COM port where your M5Stack is connected and burn the firmware. Simple. Remember to add you microSD card with M5NS.INI configuration file. See the [wiki](https://github.com/mlukasek/M5_NightscoutMon/wiki) for details.

There is a Facebook group [M5STACK NIGHTSCOUT](https://www.facebook.com/groups/606295776549008/) where you can get support and installation guides in several languages prepared by members of the M5Stack Nightscout community. Please check the [Files section](https://www.facebook.com/groups/606295776549008/files/) first and search the group before asking questions. A lot of questions have been answered already. Big thanks to Patrick Sonnerat, Didier Frétigné, Peter Leimbach and more...

### Firmware updates (OTA)

Once your M5Stack is set up and connected to Wi-Fi, you don't need a computer to keep it up to date. Open the device's web page (see [Setup](https://github.com/psonnera/M5_NightscoutMon/wiki/Setup#update-your-firmware) in the wiki) and, if a newer version is available, a **click to update** link appears. Click it and the device downloads and flashes the new firmware itself, then reboots.

Firmware is served directly from this GitHub repository — the [`Binaries/`](Binaries) folder on `master` — over HTTPS; there is no separate update server. The device automatically requests the binary matching its own board (`Basic_4MB`, `ESP32_16MB` or `CoreS3`, see [`Scripts/README.md`](Scripts/README.md#the-three-firmwares)), so a Basic, Fire, Core2 or CoreS3 all get the correct image without any manual selection.

If you maintain your own fork, see [`Scripts/README.md`](Scripts/README.md#publishing-an-ota-update) for how to build and publish updates for it.
